  - sentence: "With no other options, Andres continues to barrage Sitan with spells,
      with little to no avail. Eventually, Sitan finds an opening for him to counter
      Andres\u2019 attacks."
    speaker: 
  - sentence: I got you now!

  - sentence: Agh!

  - sentence: Sitan pounds the shield that Andres casts. With every strike, the shield

    speaker: Mayari
  - sentence: Mayari unleashes a ray of her power to Sitan.
    speaker: 
  - sentence: You face me on the verge of my victory?
    speaker: Sitan
  - sentence: Is that even a question?
    speaker: Mayari
  - sentence: A fight ensued between the two. Mayari and Sitan are neck-in-neck on
      each other, but Mayari is able to strike Sitan, incapacitating him.
    speaker: 
  - sentence: We finished this fight. Let us go and escape his sight!
    speaker: Santelmo
  - sentence: No! We still need to remove the entities from the possessed inhabitants.
      Besides, Sitan will just come back and wreak havoc in the land!
    speaker: Andres
  - sentence: Mayari looks at Andres. Seeing the book in his possession, Mayari commands
      him.
    speaker: 
  - sentence: Andres, I can't do this alone. I need Apolaki's power to stop this
      fiend's plan.
    speaker: Mayari
  - sentence: Andres, now once again capable of fighting, aids Mayari. Mayari shifts
      her power into a circular force, forming a vacuum.
    speaker: 
  - sentence: "Andres opens the book and faces it against Mayari\u2019s spell. The
      book glows and attaches itself to the spell."
    speaker: 
  - sentence: One by one, entities all over the land are sucked into the spell, releasing
      the inhabitants from them.
    speaker: 
  - sentence: Soon, the spell forms into a glass vial, and the two are able to trap
      all the entities within it.
    speaker: 
  - sentence: Is it over?
    speaker: Andres
  - sentence: We... did it.
    speaker: Ibneg
  - sentence: Now is not the time to celebrate. We must get out of here.
    speaker: Mayari
  - sentence: With mere moments before Sitan regains consciousness, Mayari uses her
      powers to block the entrance of his lair with magic, effectively trapping him
      inside.
    speaker: 
  - sentence: As the four escape the base of the volcano, they can feel the anger
      of Sitan by the earth-shaking.
    speaker: 
  - sentence: One day I'll free myself from this! And when that day comes, there
      will be a reckoning!
    speaker: Sitan
  - sentence: The four go back safely to Apolaki. The god greeted the four with great
      relief.
    speaker: 
  - sentence: I have never been happier to see you again.
    speaker: Apolaki
  - sentence: Likewise, brother.
    speaker: Mayari
  - sentence: With your efforts, the inhabitants of this place are once again safe.
    speaker: Apolaki
  - sentence: Andres sits down on the ground. Dumbfounded that he restored everything
      that he destroyed.
    speaker: 
  - sentence: On the verge of crying, Mayari approaches Andres.
    speaker: 
  - sentence: Andres, the first time I saw you, I saw regret.
    speaker: Mayari
  - sentence: Ever since then, you have restored everything you have destroyed.
    speaker: Mayari
  - sentence: "You\u2019ve helped in stopping Sitan's invasion, aided in trapping
      Sitan once again."
    speaker: Mayari
  - sentence: And you even helped poor creatures along the way.
    speaker: Mayari
  - sentence: I know it in my heart that you never intended to hurt anyone.
    speaker: Mayari
  - sentence: And I know now that you deserve a second chance.
    speaker: Mayari
  - sentence: Thank you, goddess Mayari. I could never thank you, any of you enough.
    speaker: Andres
  - sentence: But you see, it is not just my brother and I who think you deserve
      another chance.
    speaker: Mayari
  - sentence: Andres turns and he sees the creatures that once saw him in disgust
      gathered to see him, as all the forest inhabitants forgive him.
    speaker: 
  - sentence: They celebrate the restoration of their homes and lives and invite
      Andres to join them.
    speaker: 
  - sentence: A hours later, Ibneg and Andres have a conversation.
    speaker: 
  - sentence: I am glad that this is finally over.
    speaker: Ibneg
  - sentence: At least some of the burden is removed from me.
    speaker: Andres
  - sentence: True, some is the word I would use. But remember this.
    speaker: Ibneg
  - sentence: Ibneg points at the inhabitants. Celebrating that the inhabitants are
      no longer possessed.
    speaker: 
  - sentence: I just restored everything to normal.

  - sentence: Not just that, but also that.
    speaker: Ibneg
  - sentence: Ibneg points to the lair of Sitan, remembering that Sitan is now trapped
      in the base of the volcano, unable to be free.
    speaker: 
  - sentence: Mayari did most of the work.
    speaker: Andres
  - sentence: Indeed, I know you have to live the rest of your life knowing that
      you caused this.
    speaker: Ibneg
  - sentence: "But at least you made things right. And that\u2019s worth something."
    speaker: Ibneg
  - sentence: Andres smiles, starting to be able to forgive himself. Suddenly Mayari
      and Apolaki appears beside them.
    speaker: 
  - sentence: Andres Lamat, you have your chance to go back home.
    speaker: Mayari
  - sentence: How is that supposed to work exactly?
    speaker: Andres
  - sentence: You will see this as a dream. Although everything that transpired here
      is reality.
    speaker: Apolaki
  - sentence: Yet you'll wake up in your bed. As if nothing happened.
    speaker: Apolaki
  - sentence: Are you ready, Andres Lamat?
    speaker: Mayari
  - sentence: I am. Thank you, for letting me make things right.
    speaker: Mayari
  - sentence: Everything goes into pitch black.
    speaker:
